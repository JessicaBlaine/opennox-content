# Render Jack animation

Rendering will take sometime and the UI will freeze until it is done rendering, you can check out the console for progress. It will output to `output` folder of **your current working directory**.

To render single animation,
1. Go to `Scripting` tab.
2. Open `render-single.py` script.
3. Run it

To render everything, 
1. Go to `Scripting` tab.
2. Open `render-all.py` script.
3. Run it

**NOTE:** By everything, I mean scenes with `ANIM.` as prefix.
